# Assignment 2


### Objective challenge:

So that everyone gets to eat, there are some situations in which philosophers should pick up a chopstick, and some situations in which they should NOT (because another philosopher needs to use it).

Write a better solution to the dining philosophers problem so that deadlock does NOT occur.


### Objective challenge:

What you need to do is to take our pseudo-code one step further before writing code.

Take the variable list and choose what data structure or data type you will use for each variable and document your choice.
Take the list of procedures and come up with function names that will store related procedural code. For example, you may want to group all the procedural behavior that occurs when a user quits the game into a function named quit_game.


### Objective challenge:

Our game could use some improvements. Take the ending code above and change it to add the following features:

Besides the result message that gets display after every user choice, also display the computer’s choice and the current score.
If the user quits, before exiting the program, display the current score.
Besides prompting the user for their input for their choice, also display the previous round’s user choice and computer choice.
After adding those features, run your program to make sure everything is still working.

Now, sit down and write 1-2 paragraphs that explain the process you underwent to add the features to the program. Try not to just explain your new code, line-by-line, but describe your actual thought process and the high-level overview of what your new code does. Think of it the same way you would describe a painting/drawing of yours if someone asked you to explain your process. People don’t want to hear about every time you added more paint to your brush but they want to know why you chose the colors you did or your unique perspective on why you painted what you did.
