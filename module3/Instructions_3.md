# Assignment 3


### Objective challenge:

In your own words, write a short paragraph describing each of the four pillars of OOP.


### Objective challenge:

Use the planning strategy and process demonstrated above to design a parking lot. This is a common OOP interview question and the time you spend thoughtfully thinking through this problem will be helpful.

As you design your solution, and think through all of the necessary objects, attributes, methods, and relationships, keep the following in mind:

* Payments
    * What methods are allowed?
    * Where do customers pay?
* Capacity
    * How does the system respond when the lot is full?
    * How does the system know when the lot is full?
* Vehicles
    * Is capacity allocated differently depending on what type of vehicle enters the lot? How so?
* Pricing
    * Are there different rates for different times of day? How will this be handled?
    * Is there a discount for purchasing a longer total time?


### Objective challenge:

Open a Python interpreter and complete the following:

1. Define a class
2. Instantiate the class twice, storing each instance in a separate variable.
3. Print out the two class instances and make sure they are showing the class that you created and two distinct locations in memory.


### Objective challenge:

Open a python interpreter and complete the following:

1. Define a class
2. In the class definition, define the __init__, __str__, and __repr__.
3. Instantiate the class and store the instance in a variable.
4. Interact with the variable to test that the __str__ and __repr__ methods are working as you’d expect based on your definition.


### Objective challenge:

Open a Python interpreter and complete the following:

1. Define a class that makes use of a “private” getter and setter for a “private” attribute.
2. Use the property decorator to “wire up” the getter and setter methods for accessing the property on an instance.
3. Instantiate the class and store the instance in a variable.
4. Test that the getter and setter methods are working when getting the attribute’s value and setting the attribute’s value.


### Objective challenge:

In your own words, write a paragraph that describes how variable scope works in Python. Do your very best to refer the writing above as little as possible. The more effort you put into writing the explanation in your own words, the better you will be able to recall this information in the future.


### Objective challenge:

Open a Python interpreter and complete the following:

1. Define a class that has a class method that references a class attribute when called.
2. Do this once using the @classmethod decorator and a second time without using the decorator.
3. Reflect on which method you prefer and why.
